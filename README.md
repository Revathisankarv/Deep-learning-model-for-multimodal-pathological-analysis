# Deep-learning-model-for-multimodal-vocal-and-lung-signal-analysis-in-health-monitoring

This project develops a novel non-invasive health monitoring approach that integrates vocal and lung signal analysis using a hybrid deep learning model. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks with Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks (CBiRNN) and analyzing multiple data sources through Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, the system aims to provide more accurate detection of vocal and respiratory disorders and enhance early diagnosis capabilities."
